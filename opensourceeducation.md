# Open Source Education
The open source revolution in software has not yet spread to the world of education. There are open educational resources (OER) available, but there is as of yet no collaborative way to build OERs. Educators can learn from the power of platforms like GitHub for how to transform our practices. Imagine building courses the same way software is built: educators from all over the world collaboratively add to and modify an English or a Math course. Our goal with this repository is to begin this sort of transformation within computer science education in our state.
