Curricular materials for Computer Science Principles AP. Teachers who are part of the organization can add resources to the repository and modify others activities.

Start by visiting the [STANDARDS.md standards document](STANDARDS.md). Here you can find curricular resources within the repository related to individual CS Principles standards. As teachers add folders and files to the repo, the [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) file can function as an organizational tool.

Would like to get permission to duplicate the folders in to this structure.
